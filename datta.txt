The Standard provided us with a comfortable home in a perfect location (the High Line) for first time visitors.   The room had a scenic view of the downtown skyline from the 12th floor, and was well equipped with necessary amenities. The only negatives were that the room layout was strange with a open shower as you walk in on your right, which also has full view while you’re laying in bed (some might like this, if you’re into that kind of thing 😂), and the wardrobes are tiny and awkwardly set up.

Unfortunately this time round you can see how much the hotel has aged. The view here is unbeatable and the close proximity to the walk along the Hudson and Little Island is great, but it doesn't quite make up for the fact that the rooms are worn out (we had a maintenance man come to our room twice to fix things), they are noisy (not just the street noise but the pipes in the rooms! They are constantly squealing through the walls at you) and the overall service was lacklustre.   We'd just stayed at The Standard in London and it was far superior to this one. So disappointing to see this once cool and vibrant hotel just become a little meh.

Then it gets too hot and takes forever to cool. You can also hear the plumbing singing next door at random times. While it’s understood a hotel likes to make money, it would be nice to have a Nespresso or a Keurig, USB options for electronics like phones, electric toothbrush, in the room.

Umm, I am lactose intolerant like many people in the world and would have been sick if he hadn't happened to mention that. Why would anyone think that's ok??

The club looks very popular, but we didn't partake this time. The stay ended up costing us over USD150 in additional fees and taxes that we were not planning on. When we arrived, we were given a free upgrade (queen bed to king) which was nice, but a "standard room," with a king or queen bed, was supposed to come with a deep freestanding tub which was half the reason we booked this hotel. (The other half was proximity.) Something I was surprised by, was that the shower was in the middle of the room, with one of the walls clear glass...

The bath/shower has a full glass wall to the bedroom, which has a full glass wall to the outside. I think this must be awesome for hip exhibitionists who would like to flash the passers-by on the HighLine while taking a shower, but there again I am neither hip nor an exhibitionist. So I guess that didn't work out well for me when I unwittingly did this the first evening.  The area around the elevators in the lobby has moveable walls of mirrors that are used to modify the passages. Perhaps there is a reason for this other than to confuse guests, but I didn't have the energy to ask.

The standard is has 17 floors, we stayed on the 11th - the base from the sounds system could be clearly heard and even caused vibrations in our bed at certain points. The night club doesn't close until 4am, so if you are a light sleeper strap in - for 5 nights out of 7 at least.

We love the location, the room and the views over the Hudson River. Whilst the hotel sells itself, must say general staff attitude from check in to check out is very dismissive. From first greeting, to asking for the bikes that are included, to check out. Especially at check out, you would think you would receive a warm thank you for 4 nights of a considerable high invoice. The lady at the front desk was looking the other way, did not even say a word and just printed the invoice. And when asked a question about the bill, very dismissive indeed.

But I am not happy with my stay at the Standard High line for many reasons. The experience was extremely unpleasant.  First, I called in to change the credit card used for my stay the night before. To say the least the process was ludicrous. Even though I would be onsite with my credit card and license the next day I had to upload a picture of my license. Why would you need me to upload a picture of my license if I was going to be there the next day during check in and I would be able to present my license then. Complete, waste of my time.

Location, upper room views, and some of the restaurants and bar area are exceptional.  The lobby elevator situation is bad.

Nobody on the elevator could read the floor numbers so one visitor turned on a flashlight to see the floor numbers.

We also never got screen mirroring to work from our phones to the TV—and maintenance couldn’t either—so we were stuck with cable tv. Very underwhelming given how expensive it was.

Use your phone to see the numbers. (The hotel should just install a tiny pin light from the ceiling to illuminate the panel.)  Speaking of the elevators, the bar on the roof cannot be accessed from these elevators (you have to go outside and around the corner for access), but no one knows this until they get onto the elevator and press the top floor button, only to learn this. If you're a guest, this is incredibly annoying because you're always having to explain it to people. Plus, they fill up the elevator. Management should just put a little sign in there that explains what to do.

Basic: Location is good with a bunch of restaurants and shopping right outside. The actual hotel is dated, with no amenities. If you like coffee, there is no coffee machine in the room or anywhere else in the property, other than at the restaurant or overpriced room service. That leaves you needed to get dressed and go out to get coffee. Subway stations are far. Service it's ok. Gym is ok. Elevator is so dark that you cannot see the buttons to press. It's also not cheap so I will definitely look for other options in the area.$neutre$0.610439121723175$0#daniel2sullivan$tripadvisor$en$2.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/08/2022$don't stay in room 1718: If you get room 1718 honestly just go somewhere else. There's a club on the 18th floor directly above and this room is directly outside of the elevator and stairwell that they funnel people through to get to the club which goes until 4am. The security guard basically keeps the stairwell door open all night too so the noise just comes directly into the room, impossible to sleep. To make it worse the hotel doesn't accommodate you at all and you still have to go downstairs and wait in the 3 hour line to get into the club. This room should come with a complimentary pass to that club honestly for what you have to go through. The gym is also right outside of this room and the door to it slams every time someone enters, so after finally falling alseep at 4am you get woken up every 10$negative$0.5844355225563049$-0.5844355225563049#AndyStew802$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/08/2022$Great treat and service: Kabaysha was an amazing host and gave our party a very special treat - will be returning to The standard Highline to party soon!!

My previous rate was just over 300. When trying to contact them about it, they just didnt respond to any emails.

Unfortunately, it’s also directly above a nightclub (‘Brass Monkey’) that plays very loud music, outdoors, until precisely 4am. So, for the half of the rooms that are on the south side of the hotel, you will not get any sleep, at all, until some time after 4am.  If you came here to go clubbing and that’s not a problem, fine.  But if you think ‘a room you can sleep in’ is the most basic thing a hotel has to do, then this is not actually a hotel at all, and charging anything, let alone the prices here, is pretty close to fraud.$neutre$0.4716331660747528$0#Tonytouch$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/06/2022$Supreme stay!: Had the most Wonderful time st the Standard highline hotel.

It really made it hard to sleep late. 2) The shower is completely open and there are no doors. So, obviously, you can only share a room if you feel comfortable showering next to the person you share with. But the real problem is that the AC keeps the shower cold, which is annoying. 3) I know it's NYC, but there's a club on the roof and a bar right outside around 3rd floor, so there is noise.

But even 5 floors below the club, it was super loud and bumping/shaking until after 4am. The bed was also super hard. The room was small which is to be expected but the bathroom was so strange with no door to the shower and bath area so water got everywhere and no privacy. The tub took up so much unnecessary space. The staff was very kind and the other guests seemed glamorous and young, so if you are there to party you probably wouldn’t mind the things that bothered us as grumpy parents who left our kids behind and wanted some rest.$neutre$0.4734271168708801$0#Debasmith$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/05/2022$Perfect Setting for a Celebration: I live in New York but have always wanted to stay at the Standard High Line.

Our room was our evening entertainment as we watched the sun set over the Hudson after dinner and in the morning we went across the street to Little Island park and walked over to Chelsea Market.  The rooms are comfortable, fun and functional, and immaculately clean.  When I checked in and told Mandee I was celebrating my retirement she upgraded our room and had Prosecco and chocolate sent up.

You can't beat the location in Chelsea though -- can walk to the West Village, easy walk to the A,C,E lines.  First, just getting your luggage through the rotating door is a struggle. There is a hidden handicapped door but you can't see it and no bell person outside. We couldn't believe that a posh hotel would not have easily accessible open doors for travelers. It sounds like a no-brainer! We stayed in a Superior King room and the view of the Empire State Building was great! But the toilet wasn't powerful enough to flush all your business.

Location is A plus. The room has a lot to be desired. For one, the room design is feeling dated. Secondly, the room is not quiet. The hotel hands outs ear plugs because even they know the room has no insulation. You hear everything from water running through the walls to outside parties. Amenity fees and taxes add on a nice charge to the bill so also don’t expect the quoted room charge to match the actual charge.

He was generally not helpful and made me not want to interact with the front desk at all.  He also remarked that he'd give me a room "away from the hotel bar" where they have parties/social events but the room I got was right above a bar next to the hotel that threw loud parties Fri-Sun so I was up until 1am ET anyhow.  I can't imagine the staff wasn't aware of that.

But the actually room is not comfortable at all. The bed is on the floor, which is for design purposes. The bathroom is so poorly designed it is almost comical. The shower head is in the corner of the “bathroom” so basically you are showering touching the sink. And then when you’re done, the water doesn’t drain so you are standing in standing water while getting ready, drying your hair, etc. unless you take the time to mop it up. Also the sink is almost not functional if you want to fill up a glass. The toilet is in a very small separate room - if you lean forward at all you bump your head.

The entire city unfolds before you, and because its the tallest thing around, almost any floor or exposure offers a dynamite view.  It is captivating and I never turn on the TV because you have the best live show right in front of you.  The service is punctual, friendly and not at all hovering.

If nothing else their marketing people get an “A”.  The reality is a mixed bag.  The rooms for the price are not only small but lacking in function.  No furniture with any drawers.  So, better pack hang up clothes or live out of your suitcase.  I’m in good physical shape and I found the bed sitting so low to the floor a pain to deal with.  I cannot imagine anyone out of shape or with a bad back dealing with getting in and out of the bed which is basically a mattress on the floor.  The view was nice from the room with all the windows.

For starters, you will be charged an extra price than your booking based on a "resort fee". Next, the room will reek of some sort of cheap, overwhelming scent: think an adolescent boy who just discovered Axe body spray, but worse. Honestly, it hits you like a punch in the face - we should have given up them, but decided to sleep it off on the lumpy mattress. To top it off, everything has a patina of "hey, we can easily impress dumb people" in terms of decor.

The bedroom was small but worst of all is that there is no mention anywhere that the shower is separated from the bedroom by a floor to ceiling glass wall. I was with a friend but even if I’d been with a partner Im not sure I’d want to watch them shower whilst I lay in bed 2 feet away. The toilet is in a separate room but it is a small space.

As a local, I can tell you that the covid surcharge imposed by nearly all Meat Packing district restaurants is not typical of restaurants in other parts of town.  It’s annoying and more so because it’s not disclosed until you get the bill.   If you need more revenue, increase prices so we can at least see what we’re paying.

Having read several reviews, I was not expecting a lot of space and was pleased with the floor to ceiling views of downtown NYC, the Hudson, and Jersey. The room itself was clean and I was pleased with the oversized tub with a city/river view.   Given the hotel's cost and reputation, there were a lot of little things they overlooked that prevented it from being a first-class experience.

I’m glad I live in NYC, because if I stayed at the Standard while visiting New York, I would never want to come back to the city. The Standard is overpriced and overhyped choosing style over substance.   Because of Covid-19, I was forced to have a staycation this year for my birthday.

I might come back specifically for the tub sometime. That said, room service was subpar (one of our orders came back wrong, and both came back severely overcooked), and any time our neighbors used their water, we were greeted with startlingly loud hissing. Maybe we just caught a weird room on a busy weekend, but it did put a damper on things. Be aware of the USD30 facilities usage fee they ambush you with when you are checking in, despite the fact that I would never use the facilities they charged me for during a pandemic.

I have no qualms in saying the people here are the best.

When I ordered room service, the person helping us even offered to stand six feet away from the cart they were delivering our food on for a relatively contactless experience.

I think this hotel would be better suited for a longer stay where you can sit in its Biergarten and enjoy some of the other amenities it provides.  As soon as we entered, we were delighted by the unique design of the lobby. Marble concierge desks sit at the far end of the room between funky wall partitions with holes in them that light streams in through. Similarly, our room was very well-designed and had a futuristic feel to it. The room design avoids harsh lines, meaning all corners are curved. For instance, a wooden panel curves from behind the bed up to the ceiling. There was also a rounded table in a little nook with a curved couch. It looks very cool.

I called down because I had issues with the TV not working and someone was suppose to come up but never did. I called and asked for hair caps and it took 45 min for them to come up and I had to call twice. The toilet wasn’t flushing properly. I had food delivered and they never called up to notify me or had anyone send it so it was just sitting in the lobby and when I went up to the front there was at least four employees at the front desk. A second time I had good delivered there was no one at the front desk and my delivery guy could not get up to my room he had to wait for 15 min because I could not come down. The customer service was horrendous. I will never stay here a again$negative$0.7057403922080994$-0.7057403922080994#Rick S$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/09/2020$Weekend Bliss!  Service, Food & Views: Went to the standard this weekend with some friends as we wanted some sense of normalcy. The hotel is extremely carful and really ensuring that guests are safe.  The restaurants are opened on the rooftop and the outdoor space on the ground level which are extremely nice.  We had eaten at all 3 areas and the food was amazing and service was great.  Everyone is being extremely nice during this time and are very accommodating.  With COVID I though I would add this review and those going above and beyond during this time.

I have stayed in nicer motels than this. The carpet and tiles were both gross and breaking/fraying in places. The toilet made a horrifically loud noise every time it was flushed. The bed was so lumpy and so worn that when you laid down it was as if your head was lower than your body (upside down). I tried calling for room service and it took forever for the person to understand I wanted “the continental breakfast.” I was told 15-20 min but was called back almost 15 min later to tell me that had no croissants. There is no fridge or safe, again things I have had in cheap motels. Also, I checked out around 8:30a yesterday and have yet to get my receipt that was to be emailed.

So I had an idea of the feel and ambience prior to checking in. The Standard is the perfect combination of a hip, trendy chic NYC hotel in the best location in my opinion. Walking distance to many high end eateries and shopping with plenty to see and do around. We checked in at 4ish front desk employee was EXTREMELY friendly and welcoming.

I wanted to DO something, which is tough right now during the pandemic. But I saw that many hotels in NYC were have special pricing at the moment, due to almost no tourism, so it occurred to me that a stay at The Standard High Line meant that the thing I could do is... walk the High Line, hooray, for the first time in almost a year! So that's what we did, and I was so happy. At check-in, our room was upgraded, which was so lovely - the beautifully designed rooms are a treat - and we had a spectacular view of downtown, the Whitney, the Hudson, the Statue of Liberty, etc. The floor-to-ceiling windows really give the best glistening snapshot of the City. Plus, I always felt safe and well-cared for.

David checked us in swiftly and provided excellent recommendations which led us to the Standard Grill for dinner two nights in a row--an extra thanks to Maire for taking care of us there.

Overall, a beautiful and hip hotel. I stayed on a discounted rate for their Reopening Promotion so I got a good deal. Would I pay USD400+ to stay here normally? Probably not. A basic room is definitely not worth it. But if they run promotions again, I would come back. Perfect for a staycation for all city dwellers.   First some updates from what I originally wrote:  - Two different people emailing me to confirm my check in/check out time (I chose the rate where you can come and go as you please). Disorganized.

Only things we'd change is the music in the public spaces was overbearing and less-than-ideal ("Greatest Hits of the 70s and 80s" type stuff) and the downstairs bar/coffee shop service left something to be desired--had to ask for change, difficulties getting attention of the servers, etc.$positive$0.8020992279052734$0.8020992279052734#Anna Y$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/03/2020$Delicious drinks: I had the pleasure to go to Le Bain right before the Christmas holiday and what a time it was.

I flew all the way across the country and just go out of a cab and the front desk/management really failed on an opportunity to have a customer for life.

Perhaps cool people only drink from the minibar? Early morning vodka isn't always helpful for a work trip.

After all of these years, I recently attended one of my favorite events yet, Queens on Ice hosted by Joe Harris.   The event was at the seasonal ice skating rink that is on the ground floor at the standard, outside of the grill. There were theme cocktails, warm drinks, heat lamps, amazing music, and of course drag queens killing performances on ice!

The location and style always outweighed the indifferent (though improved) staff and poor dining options. The view was always incredible, and the neighborhood was hard to beat.   However, my last visit, from 1/14-1/16 is making me reconsider the Maritime, the Gansevoort and the Dream.   The simple reason is that when I entered my room late on Thursday evening, I was greeted with a giant cockroach (hard to tell scale in the picture). I was lucky enough to be able to stomp on him before he got away, but, as you might imagine, it was impossible to fall sleep, knowing his friends and family might be lurking nearby.

There were no doormen either which was a little frustrating as we'd been travelling for several weeks and had a lot of luggage.   The check-in was fast and friendly and the agent took extra time to find us a room she thought we'd like - high floor, but not too close to the rooftop club and with a shower rather than bath.

The Security guard even was irritated with the manager’s decision. We Loved the Top of the Standard and the hotel staff was very gracious considering our complaint.

Hands down one of the best looking bellman I’ve ever seen and if you come to this hotel, make sure to ask for Kosta. He proceeded with helping with my carry on and eventually arrived at the front desk. I later came down and found Kosta outside and asked him for recommendations for dinner and drinks.

We had a Deluxe king room at USD600 a night. The hotel has a great, young, chic vibe and I understand why people feel at home here. The location is great and you are right at the Highline. Our room on the 5th floor had Hudson River views but the design of the room was annoying. First of all why obscure the view and put a huge flat screen tv in the middle of the floor to ceiling window. It not only obscured the river view but it obscured the view from the table too. And it is so low your blankets obscured the remote control sensor since the bed is also one foot off the ground. The light in the shower was a tiny puck light very insufficient. There were no hooks to hang towels anywhere except two in the shower over the hot tub.

What make it great?  The attitude of the staff and it's apparent that their manager, Terry, knows what he's doing.  Although we love the Miami one, the staff has a bit of a hipster attitude which makes guests sometimes feel like they don't measure up.  Also, the food at the Lido isn't that great, although the atmosphere is fabulous.  I wish that I could move all of the components that make this High Line standard down to the Miami one.

We stayed in the Hudson suite for 2 nights, and with a USD850-a-night price tag, this room category is definitely NOT recommended. Here’s some of the things that were not up to par:  - no slippers, toothbrushes or kettle - these items should be supplied in-room for suite categories and above instead of having to be requested from housekeeping; that just reeks of management trying to cut costs.  - ugly decor - the hotel pictures show a nice sunset pic of the Hudson River which makes the room look rather posh, but what they don’t show you is that the other half of the room is covered in cheap-ish red tiles that$neutre$0.9497092366218567$0#UrsulaJFeher$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/10/2019$Dinner in NY: Had a drink at the Brauhause before dinner  Great service and drinks loved the bartender Adam friendly and  knowledgeable  Dinner at  the grill  Food fantastic  we had the special the foi.

When I went to close the drapes at night, the blackout curtain got caught about a foot shy of closing and would not go all the way. As for the noise ... I guess I should not be surprised as it was a Saturday night in a chic hotel but being two floors beneath the nightclub, I could hear and feel the music playing until the early hours.

The deep bathtub has a glass wall in it, providing clear views of the rest of the room and whatever happened to be outside my giant floor-to-ceiling window. I suspect the glass is intended to be a sexy detail for romantic overnights, but whatever, I used it to watch trashy TV from the bathtub.

The hotel is indeed very conveniently located and has a very fresh, vibrant feel clearly appealing to a younger clientele. The German beer garden is a little anomalous but nevertheless good fun while the bar, restaurants and gym were all very cool. The brunch was particularly good. The gym is up on the 17th floor and has its cardio machines lined along the floor to ceiling windows which is a little disconcerting for people like me with a fear of heights as it feels like you are running/cycling/skiing out towards the edge.

The front desk staff (eszter comes to mind, but they're all very welcoming) whisks you painlessly through the paperwork and either you can take their seriously postmodern elevator (you'll know what I mean when you get inside) to your room or stop at the outdoor cafe for a Martini (my preference). You know, these places always want you to mention staff members by name but at age 75, I can't, sorry.    I can tell you that there is not a more welcoming, warm and efficient staff in any hotel in the U.S. (and forget Europe altogether).

Check-in was one of the quickest I've experienced with no lines. The room itself was average I would say. I had a king room with a view of the Empire State. It was somewhat small. There was no iron or ironing board in the room and the full length window lets a LOT of light in the morning. Frankly the standard king room is average and not memorable other than the view.   The Top of The Standard and the Standard Grill are the showpieces of the hotel with great views and service. The onsite club, Le Bain, can't be beat but entrance is not guaranteed as the front desk advises.   The location can't be beat for trendy restaurants and shopping.

I understand that they have no control over construction, but the very least they could do is to tell you about it when you book directly with the hotel. Same for the closed bar (which is a big part why we used to like this hotel). On top of everything, they were doing maintenance on the windows, so we were asked to keep our curtains closed to avoid having someone peeking in your room. Seriously?

I’d say a little on the small size and with a 70s retro kind of feel.

I am an attorney and don’t normally post reviews but felt compelled to in this instance. I had been to the Standard for drinks before and was excited to stay at the hotel because of the good amenities, which are the roof top bar and club. We paid nearly USD500 per night. When we arrived, we were informed that the rooftop bar was off limits to guests as it had been reserved for private parties for three nights. We were very disappointed in our experience and there were NO apologies for it. We were subsequently told by staff (nonchalantly) not to book in December because the amenities were generally booked for the month of December. If you ever go here, you should call in advance to confirm no private parties.

You can tell that the hotel has a few years on its back and I miss out on small details in the hotel like toothpaste etc.  Nice bar with great views but it also feels a bit "old". There are better options of rooftop bars in the city.  We were also a bit bothered with a quite intense smell of pot in the room. I believe there was a neighbour smoking near by...

The architect and interior designer of this hotel elevated form over function. On the positive side, the staff were friendly and attentive, the rooms are bright and clean, with a lot of wood trim. But the rooms were not functional for us. To begin with the side of the tub/shower is clear glass so that everything is clearly visible from the sleeping area. While the toilet area has its own room, if someone turns on a light over the sink at night it lights up the bedroom. The bed and seating area are about 16 inches off the floor, making it difficult for older folks to get up.

They have a psychedelic video playing.   At first I thought the layout was a bit odd but it worked out well. It had a quirky and sophisticated take on their design. I like that the room included an umbrella. It was raining most of the time. Guest have an option to buy it.

I came here for work, although it was a much needed break away from my 3 1/2-year-old twin boys. LOL. Melinda S. checked me in at the front desk. We commiserated for a short bit of how she is a twin as well, and I commended her mother for having survived the beautiful but trying experience.  Melinda must have taken heart to me because she said she would send wine to my room and what did I prefer? Expecting a glass of wine to arrive, I was completely blown away when she came up herself to deliver a bottle of red.

Walk around, ask someone (yes they are friendly) -- five bucks for a cup of coffee.  Dinner at the grill?  Fifty bucks for a hamburger and salad (includes tax and tip). Hotel is cool styling but the rooms, really, too small and the boom boom boom at night from the club is annoying.

My only comment would be that for the price (and I know that NY hotel rooms are small) the rooms are small. We were in one of the top of the range ones and even found that small.

Well, the Swiss proudly believe to have the best hoteliers in the world. However, New Yorkers believe they have the vest hotels in the world - evidenced by the fact you have to pay over USD400 to stay in anything less than a hovel.

First, the front signage hangs upside down without illumination, making it difficult to find the entrance.  Riding the elevator to/from the room gives a rider a vertigo attack.

The bed was not comfortable.  The room was not comfortable due to design choices:   no shelf in the closet (there's ample room) so you can place things that don't go on hangers; no hooks for your towels; no door on the shower.

The reasons I do not award 5* are the lift system was chaotic --- calling a lift took 5mins+ and once inside it felt like a lottery trying to select the correct floor --- and it feels like the 'cool' is wearing off, it's not as fresh as when it opened and I don't know what they can do to give it the buzz back$positive$0.8516992330551147$0.8516992330551147#david_villa78$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/01/2017$Much more than a Standard hotel!: The Standard High Line stands above an old elevated section of New York's railway system.

We didn't eat there but it looked good. I can't recommend trying to get into Bingo enough - this was by far the highlight of the weekend. Its like a big NYE party with bingo. SO FUN!

If you are looking for a trendy scene, it's all of that. The hotel staff were friendly, efficient and very accommodating. The rooms were small, but I expect that in Manhattan, and yes the shower area is open to your room. The restaurant was ok, certainly not 5 star. My overall impression was one and done.

We had a few hiccups with the reservations team, whom I found to be quite curt and unaccommodating, so when we checked in, I had set the bar low (even though as I mentioned I love the brand.)

A great location, an elegant rooftop bar, an outdoor beer garden and access to the high line and some of the best views in NYC.  However, the hotel staff is more interested in the lobby scene than the hotel guests. From arrival without a doorman to a delayed room availability, misplaced luggage, and a nauseating elevator ride, the hotel has that distinct Vegas like over used feel that makes you think about who was in your room before you. Even the revolving door spun out of control and despite the best efforts of security, you had to navigate through a lobby  filled with club goers and millennials in the dark to reach the elevators to your room.

Room was a tiny bit small and really pricey but worth every penny as it was a special trip. Le Baine (rooftop bar and club was very cool), top of the standard for stylish cocktails and lush breakfast in the standard grill.

Interesting beach-like cafe adjacent to entrance with white stone gravel, patio tables, striped umbrellas and lush potted plants -a nice spot for "meeting up". Busy restaurants and roof-top bar appear to be popular with locals as well as guests. Overall a very youthful vibe - most guests and employees are under 35. Most of the employees had good people skills.  My room was narrow with a queen sized bed. Toilet separate chamber from bath, sink, & shower area.

Room was clear and, by New York standards large, but not terribly comfortable.  Was sparsely furnished with no real work area, a severe deficit of power outlets, and fairly uncomfortable chairs and bed.  Bathroom was poorly designed and cramped.  Upon arriving, there was a line for check in about 6 people deep with only two staff working the front desk.  Restaurant scene was very vibrant and loud. The earplugs offered as an amenity in the bathroom should have been a clue that the restaurant is not the only part of this hotel that was loud.

I had a nice view of the river and was quiet even 4 floors up. One of the only places I never really had any complaints about.

I would definitely recommend staying in a room on a higher floor with a view. The location is great because the hotel lobby is connected to the Biergarten and in the middle of meatpacking.

But I had read some of the online reviews and was a little apprehensive that it would be too stuffy or aloof for us, particularly since it was noted as one of the trendiest hotels in one of the hottest,$positive$0.628924548625946$0.628924548625946#Jo D$tripadvisor$en$1.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/05/2016$So loud!: We stayed here for one night, and from the moment we arrived (7pm) until 3am, it sounded like our room was inside the club.

If your looking for great shopping (Chelsea market, Vince, Rag and Bone, All Saints, to name a few) great Dinning (Spice Market, Old Homestead, Morimoto, Buddakan, Tao) great clubs (Provocatour, Marquee) then really to look any further than this hotel is a waste of time. It's perfect for singles or couples looking to immerse themselves in the hip bubble of indulgence that the Meatpacking has to offer. The Standard is a great value for what they provide....  The bed and the pillows were so comfy. Made for every type of sleeper. (I sleep on my stomach and side so I need a pillow that's squishy soft and has "give"- these pillows had that).

We were in luck, fair enough it was an afternoon in February - hardly the time of day/year for the 'glamazons' to be packing venues. Absolutely loved it, we were lucky.....clear blue skies, freezing cold with snow but the views were fabulous and the drinks were delicious and not crazy expensive. Two drinks were USD40, we paid up to USD30 in run of the mill bars later that day and bar snacks are not overly priced.  It's a lovely treat but do the make the extra effort to look smart or even chic as you'll enjoy it even more.  It could be a little intimidating but rise above it and enjoy......the staff are so welcoming and among the most beautiful people I've seen who are not on the cover of a fashion$positive$0.5806471109390259$0.5806471109390259#bpzed$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/03/2016$Fantastic service: I didn't stay here but my sister and her husband did, for their anniversary.

That should be fine, apart from in the evening when they close two of the elevators off to paying hotel guests and reserve them for the exclusive use of the top floor bar. When we stayed, one elevator was out of service and yet they still closed two off for the bar, leaving a single elevator to serve the hotel (including room service trolleys and laundry etc).

There is no separate elevator for the bar and there were problems with the elevators anyway. One day it took us 15 mins just to get down to the lobby!

They had plenty of specialty drinks as well as carrying my not so oft carried brand of Jack Daniels.

In fact, it is not the fancy-traditional-luxury hotel experience, with concierge and personal waiters at every corner and ready to satisfy all of the client's needs and wishes.

Amazingly cool hotel in an amazing location in the trendy Meatpacking District. My 17 year old daughter and I had a brilliant time at The Standard, High Line - we felt safe and very comfortable in our room (1310) - a corner room with full length windows providing a panoramic view of New York you could never grow tired of! The staff were amazing, especially Lee Anne -  they were very accommodating and friendly which always makes a stay enjoyable. I have to make a special mention about the Manager, Kevin Rockey, who was absolutely wonderful and made our stay very special. I can throughly recommend the hotel as place to stay in New York - in one word - amazing!$positive$0.8762220144271851$0.8762220144271851#A380FlyBoy$tripadvisor$en$4.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/10/2015$Fun but a bit too cool for school...: Staying at The Standard is like being on a movie set. Beautiful people everywhere. The place is crawling with 'cool.' If it was any cooler, it'd freeze over. You really need to plan your wardrobe! Guys, shoes but no socks..  The hotel is funky and impressive architecturally but the rooms are small so don't plan on unpacking and/or spending a whole lot of time in them. Comfortable bed and tasteful decor are the other room highlights.  We had a city view which includes the Empire State Building but the river view including downtown is the pick. With the USDA a mess, we just didn't want to pay the difference. As it was we were up for nearly USD600 per night.  The bars/nightclubs on level 18 are definitely worth a visit, mind you it's a hassle.

The waiter in the first floor bar served cold coffee twice and is totally green because he has no training.

The room itself was very nice, not very big, but plenty enough room for two, the peekaboo shower was fab and the tub was large enough for two to bathe in and still be able to take in the fantastic view of downtown Manhattan whilst sipping on some bubbly and chilling in the bubbles (wish I was back there now).

It was a great place to stay.  The hotel itself has a cool atmosphere, it is busy and fun. The location is right on the highline, so there is loads to do within a 30 minute radius.  The atmosphere in the area a little less intense than downtown, so really nice if you are there for a slightly longer stay.  The rooms aren't massive but they really don't need to me.  They are perfectly finished and the bluetooth speaker is a nice touch.  The view from the room was absolutely stunning, probably the best of any hotel I have ever stayed at.

We all know the Standard High Line has beautiful simple design, and that rare, exciting chic feeling.

Let's just go through some highlights:  -> Bryce Walsh took 4 calls from tired/hungover me early in the AM, solving all 4 of my problems with ease. -> I believe his name was Matt, but he managed to get us in at the Lounge upstairs, with a very difficult crew configuration, and was nothing but accommodating as I called for help. -> Terrell Caruth & Wesley were rocking smooth styles at the front desk. -> Tim the concierge connected me with an incredibly modern florist to deliver flowers to girl for me, and got seats for me$neutre$0.41910555958747864$0#Lemontree1111$tripadvisor$en$5.0/5$/api/establishments/35$25/09/2015$Great Time: Decided to stay here for the weekend  and we had such a great time, what made my stay even better was the staff.

This hotel really falls down on the service side - the little things that make your life easier whether travelling for business or pleasure.    Room service food consistently arrives cold and late.  Substitutions on the menu are not permitted, and the menu is grossly overpriced for what is delivered, even for NY.  It's the same story in the downstairs restaurant, a very limited menu poorly executed.

Room was small but comfortable. Bathroom adequate although those of a more modest persuasion may not appreciate the open to view shower. Restaurant service and food in the evening was good, although queues for toilets (even the men's) were surprising. Reception staff and room cleaners were professional and friendly. Now the downsides; we tried to book the rooftop bar for a couple of pre-dinner drinks and was told our minimum spend has to be USD200+tax per person. Sheer greed. And on arrival on Thursday they told us both the Biergarten and roof top bars were out of bounds for private functions. Greed again!

This is the price you are supoused to pay for USD500/ night average. What is ridiculous: if you arrive late in the evening after a intercontinental flight, you will hardly see the entrance of the hotel, totally confused by groups of people standing up with glasses and waiting on the line to a disco/bar. In the front desk, a trendy girl with yellow hair wont say hello or welcome, but with sad face will give you the room key. Elevators are black, no lights, black buttons and psicodelic films on the walls, hardly will you find the button of your floor. Rooms are small and clean.

It essentially has everything you need to stay entertained.  It's very self-contained and well-located.  The rooms are standard for New York and includes a comfortable bed and modern decor. (NOTE: the shower isn't private).    On the other hand, hotel staff appears to be uninformed and attempts to hide this by answering every question in the vaguest manner possible.

I must admit that the overall decor of the hotel is not for me, though possibly some people must like it. I found it dark and confusing. The lift is so dark that all of us were fumbling to find which buttons to press. The room was bright, with a great view of the river due to the floor to ceiling windows.

However, after adjusting my attitude I found that the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They seem to show a genuine interest in making sure that you are taken care of.

Plus the High Line Park is the gem of Manhattan.  Plus....there's an Apple Store around the corner and the relish Chelsea Market 2 blocks away (try Taco #1 there, reasonable and super tasty for a quick bite).  All the workers were super friendly and accommodating, consistently willing to be of service from the grill, to the beer garden, to the front desk, etc.  Yes it;s a super hip hotel yet the room are well compact but well designed and comfortable.

I don't know what's going on with the water pipes, but it's noisy.  * Noise staircase: I woke up several times because people from Le Bain were coming down the staircase on heels (between 2AM and 5AM) making loud noises.  * Noise boomboomroom/Le Bain: Throughout the entire night of the stay I heard booming music from the BoomBoomRoom or Le Bain.

This hotel came highly recommended. And I believe and accept that alot of people would like it. Why? I'm not sure. I think the Meat Packing District and the hotel are 'on trend' right now.  I just hated it. It was FAR too cool for school. To the point where I wondered if any of the people who designed the hotel had actually done any sort of hospitality training. Whilst aesthetics can be liked or disliked (I personally think that bakelite is no longer used for a reason), the fundamental parts to a hotel should not be caught up in the 'personal taste' section.

We started on 16th floor, moved to 15th but still too noisy, finally got some sleep on floor 7.

The standard of the fitting is poor with decor coming apart, and in particular, a bath handle the simply fell off and could not turn off the water without a lot of messing about trying to make it work - all in full view of the street - no curtains - great if you are exhibitionist.

The room was OK, bit small and I can't say I liked the "open bathroom" with no door. View was stunning in fairness but there were other issues. On the Saturday & Sunday, I could not concentrate to do some work due to drilling constantly in the afternoon (working on the 18th floor I was told when I rang to ask when the hell it would stop). On the Monday night, my colleagues and I went up to the bar on the roof (The Top of The Standard or Boom Boom Room) and were not allowed in!! (Private Function apparently).

We got the Hudson Studio, which they seemed very proud of, I am not sure why. It was small, and made worse by the poor room layout. Somebody was so intent on making every last inch of outside wall into a window that they completely forgot other things. Like convenience. And common sense. Does the toilet room really need a floor to ceiling glass wall? The shower is completely see through and sits almost in the center of the room, as does the bath tub. Seriously? Why? The finishes are extremely cheap and beat-up, the furniture uncomfortable, the bed hard and low to the floor.

This review, though, may be a little tainted by my disappointment in the High Line which I found too antiseptic and too hemmed in by new construction and gentrification.  I had a comfortable stay and nice bright room, but to me, the hotel is over-priced. I doubt many of its rooms actually end up going for the published list price, but I ended up paying in the 300s using Hotel Tonight and it wasn't worth that much to me given other choices I know I could have made.

They need to tone it down big time. We were there 4 nights and only one night was great (the first night on Friday).

We're a 50+ semi  retired couple and have been to NY a couple of times before and we're looking for a different experience. The reviews of the Standard sounded great so we jumped in.   Our first concern was the reported noise from the roof top night club so we took the advice received on this site  and asked for a room on the 9th to 11th floors and received one, through a special request, on the 10th floor. This was an excellent outcome as we heard no noise from above during the week we were there, including Friday and Saturday nights.

We had to book 2 rooms as there was no way an extra bed would fit in any of the rooms, not even the suites.  The standard room was aptly described as a "capsule" by another TripAdvisor reviewer. My husband and I stayed in a corner suite which was only slightly larger but considerably more expensive. We were very disappointed with the service often spending half an hour before someone took our order and another half an hour trying to track someone down to sign for the bill.

I think some of the reviewers with negative comments go to the Highline with the wrong expectations. It is not a luxurious, cushy hotel. It has a different vibe.  Its styling is more modern and trendy but that is okay and the décor reflects this modern and minimalist style.

Guests rate last. Sleep, just above that. The receptionist told a guest checking in to an upper floor that it may be an issue if they were "sensitive to noise": good advice! Those with ears are better served elsewhere. We were on a slightly lower floor and I needed my noise cancelling earbuds for sleeping. On Saturday night, even they were beaten.

The Standard seemed like the epicenter of the action, and the property was absolutely teeming with people all day long.  We had no problem with this activity.  In fact, it was exciting to be part of the buzz, as we enjoyed The Standard Grill and rooftop clubs.  And, The Standard’s location above the Highline is unmatched.  Our room was comfortable, if somewhat small.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable.  We had some disappointments, though.

I stayed in room 1506 during my most recent visit and enjoyed the great views of the city.

By the way, the fitness centre on level 17 has an amazing view of the Hudson River.

Perhaps so much so that they are spreading themselves a little too thin and finding ways to make stays here a little bit more special.  As a boutique, chic or whatever you want to call it hotel, TSH makes no small emphasis that it is a 'stand out from crowd' hotel. One that is HIP or at least different from say a commercial one with the typical luxurious amenities. Given that the modern traveler would probably dismiss amenities anyway but bear in mind, there are also other essentials that the discerning traveler too looks for.  What TSH does so well, also spoils the experience for the hotel guests. And as a guest, you will be easily forgiven to think that they are first a hangout place and second a hotel.

The views, however, are awesome from pretty much every room, enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows.  There are, unfortunately, some problems: housekeeping was maddeningly uneven, never quite doing the same thing (after I call for an extra soap bar for the shower, the next day BOTH bars are removed from the bathroom...) and often slow in responding.

Newcomers might do well to note the address.  Look not for words, but an impossibly bright yellow revolving door - that is the unmistakable indication that you have arrived. In some ways, the hotel feels like a fantasy:  Undulating spongiform textures in the lobby; handsome, friendly and capable staff; stark, semi-industrial design with a 'wink'.

Its location, in the low-rise Meat Packing district, means that every room is afforded a great view, and the views from the higher floors are quite stunning. Our advice is to ask for a river rather than city view as the southerly aspect is the best, and provides a view of the downtown skyline as well as the Hudson. The rooms are well designed to maximise the view, with floor to ceiling windows and a design which creates a sense of space in what are average sized rooms.

This hotel has quickly become my "home-away-from home." I will break down my review into three different categories:  -Staff: I choose to stay at the Standard because of its people. The staff here are notable precisely because they treat you like a friend, not like royalty. (It is 2013. I don't need a butler to draw me a bath.)

The only downside is that we were on floor 15 and we could hear music quite loudly from the club on 18th floor that went on until after 3am.

The upstairs bar is super-cool - although the reception staff are rather unwelcoming - but concierge staff on the other hand were always friendly and helpful.

Unfortunantly, the hot tub and roof top terrace were closed for renovations. That should have been pointed out to us when making reservations. The fitness center had great views and good equipment.  The restaurants at the base of the hotel are nice but pricey.  A small cup of "warm" decaf will cost you USD5.50 and the servers are a bit too cool for me.

After my fifth stay at the Standard hotel in NY, things just seem to continue to be going downhill.   When the Standard opened, it was a art induced, well polished property that supermodels and profitable artists flocked to.  The service has never been good.. it has actually always been pretty horrible.. but at least it looked good.   Now not so much.  The hotel is prematurely aging.  As soon as you get out of your cab you can see the worn bright yellow paint and the weathered doors.  The white structure in the lobby has turned a dirty grey.  The Marco Brambilla video art in the elevator, something everyone should see,  suffers from neglect with dirty screens and dust and debris covering the mirrors that are part of the experience.

We usually stay at another hotel in Soho and thought we'd try The Standard - but we fled after one night and will not be going back.  Where to start?  First off, our room was just badly designed. The exposed shower leaked onto the carpet in the hallway - we had to build a dyke of towels to contain the water. The toilet room was far away from the bathroom. To get to one side of the bed you had to navigate a maze of furniture, the tv and other obstacles - finally stepping over the bed.

The hotel room itself had amazing floor to ceiling views. The decor was cool, but the room happened to smell a bit like a mix of cigarette and sweat.  Another negative was that on the first night, the boom boom room (night club on the top floor) was playing music so loud I could feel it from the ceiling ALL NIGHT.

Two fire alarms in two days in late hours of the night and all guests evacuated down to lobby, first night told false alarm, second told real fire but contained but no fire trucks ever arrived and people pacing in lobby, no manager made an appearance but very young receptionist left to deal with disgruntled guests on his own - not right.

After spending close to 1 hour on the line, the bouncer asks us "who invited us?" and when we reply that we are guests of the hotel, who just flew in, he says "sorry but this bar is private after 10 PM".  That is nonsense after paying 300 USD for the night.  I will never return to this hotel.

Now to the negative things: the service is rediculously bad. Hardly ever a smile or "welcome" from anyone, slow service, totally random whether someone helps you with luggage etc. Finally the Standard does nothing to make customers feel that they are main focus of the staff and the hotel as such.

The rooms are a bit unusual at first (for instance, there's a window in the shower that looks onto the bed), and the windows are *very* clear (to the point that there's a letter when you arrive asking you to be mindful of what the patrons in the High Line park can see!).

The shower must be mentioned: great rain shower-head, only separated from the room by a glass wall.

I was astonished that I was not greeted properly, never offered even water or anything as I had to wait in the uncomfortable lobby for two hours.

I've stayed at a number of other NY Hotels for business travel and this by far the best one.  Here are some of the reasons I love The Standard:  *The rooms:  For NY these rooms are very spacious.  Each room has a "window wall" which is amazing.  I could sit in my room all day and stare out the window.  I've stayed on both sides of the hotel, but prefer the side with the city view, so I always ask for that side.   *Design:  The rooms are very modern but still feel very comfortable.

The Standard offered me a very nicely sized room, comfortable bath, private toilet, awesome shower,  great view, friendly staff...all for a rate that I don't expect to be sustained.

The fitness center has top notch equipment and amazing views.  My only complaint it the room service and lack of coffee.

When I read that the new Standard Hotel, latest in mini group of Andre Balazs hotels, had fabulous Hudson River views, I knew I had to stay there.   I’m a sucker for water—lakes, oceans, rivers, ponds and fountains.  Something about being by water makes me happy.  The view of the river made me smile ear to ear. With floor to ceiling windows, the vista from our room in the 337-room Standard, located smack dab in one of the coolest parts of town, was jaw dropping.  The book shaped hotel, built on huge concrete stilts over the newly opened Hi Line  in the Meat Packing District, offers panoramic vistas of sky, water and land of lower Manhattan, the Hudson River, Statue of Liberty and New Jersey.

On the positive side, meatpacking is a vibrant lively area with great restaurants and up-market shopping and The Standard is located right in the heart of this. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, rooms are a little small but typical of NYC, but there are great views across the city. We had a room on the 11th floor and from our bath we could look out across the city, taking advantage of the floor to ceiling window.

Our room had dual views over the Hudson and The Empire State Building.  The room was gorgeous, very stylish, with a very cool layout including a bathroom divided from the main bedroom by only a glass screen.  The bars, cafe and restaurant downstairs just add to the vibe. Look out also for the really cool video display in the lifts!  The Meat Packing area itself is so much fun with lots going on in the evenings and real gritty character during the day.  Greenwich Village is also an easy walk. Whatever you do eat at Budakan restaurant just a couple of minutes from the hotel, and its also worth visiting the very moving World Trade Centre Museum nearby, and if you have time the Chelsea Market Food Tour.

When we booked the room, I made it clear we wanted to pay cash for our room, which it didn't seem to be a problem when I contacted the hotel. However, our problems with the service started at the check in: the person who received us was not prepared for this method of payment, uncomfortable and almost annoyed, insisting in authorizing the full amount of our stay in our credit card.

There is only one soap bar in the bathroom so you need to transfer it back and forth between the bathroom and the shower.  I completely agree with previous reviewes - there should be a line between function and design, and this hotel just did not get it.

It was a great hotel; very trendy both inside and out but not at all intimidating. So different from a chain hotel in midtown. The staff also looked the part; they were helpful especially at check in - giving us a south facing room (which are a higher rate than what we had paid). The room (queen standard) was cool. A little on the small side (not much room to have two suitcases open) but the floor to ceiling views were fantastic. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the design of the rooms.

Because of the very modern design, yes, some water does get around the bathroom etc but who cares?  The AC does work with a min temp of 60F.
